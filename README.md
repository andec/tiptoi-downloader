# Tiptoi Downloader

This is a downloader for the gme-files as used by the
[Ravensburger Tiptoi](http://tiptoi.com) product.

It is intended to replace the basic functionalities of Tiptoi Manager
for Linux users.

## Features
Browse the available books and download the corresponding gme file.

## Missing and not planned
Audio books and songs for the new "Tiptoi with player" as this has some sort of
DRM enabled.

## Requires
 - Ruby
 - Nokogiri gem
 - HighLine gem
